This was my first ever serious CTF and I am very happy for I managed to finish. (?153th place? kinda weird because my rankings kept oscilating from 140 to 153 to 180... but anyway)

All the native binaries challenges were solved in sort of a dynamic-analysis-way, because my experience with static analysis is not very broad *yet*. My experience with writing writeups are, as one can easily tell, null, so please bear with me if I brushed up an explanation or made logic jumps somewhere.

I plan to talk a bit more about the challenges [here](https://kumahooks.github.io/2022/11/17/Flare-On-9.html).
